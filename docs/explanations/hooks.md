## Overview

In scenarios where the **fast path is empty**, goroutines fallback to retrieving objects from the **ring buffer**. If **blocking mode** is enabled and the ring buffer is also empty, the goroutine **blocks**, waiting for a writer to return an object.

At **high concurrency**, this can lead to a situation where one or more goroutines remain **indefinitely blocked**, waiting for an item that might not arrive ‚Äî for instance, if the system becomes temporarily imbalanced with more readers than writers.

To mitigate this, we check if there are any **blocked readers** before deciding how to return an object:

```go
blockedReaders := p.pool.GetBlockedReaders()
if blockedReaders > 0 {
	err := p.slowPathPut(obj)
	if err != nil {
		p.logIfVerbose("[PUT] Error in slowPathPut: %v", err)
	}
	return err
}
```

If blocked readers are detected, we trigger the **slow path**, which attempts to push the object back to the ring buffer to unblock them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Unblocking with Hooks

To further improve responsiveness under load, we introduced a **pre-blocking hook** called `preWriteBlockHook`. This hook allows the ring buffer to **attempt to unblock itself** just before actually blocking a reader. This might involve recycling objects from the fast path or performing any custom logic that can unblock waiting readers.

Here‚Äôs the implementation of `waitWrite`, showing the use of the hook:

```go
func (r *RingBuffer[T]) waitWrite() (ok bool) {
	r.blockedReaders++

	if r.wTimeout <= 0 {
		// Try hook before blocking
		if r.preWriteBlockHook != nil && r.preWriteBlockHook() {
			log.Println("[WAITWRITE] PreWriteBlockHook returned true")
			r.blockedReaders--
			return true
		}
		r.writeCond.Wait()
		r.blockedReaders--
		return true
	}

	start := time.Now()
	defer time.AfterFunc(r.wTimeout, r.writeCond.Broadcast).Stop()

	// Try hook before blocking
	if r.preWriteBlockHook != nil && r.preWriteBlockHook() {
		log.Println("[WAITWRITE] PreWriteBlockHook returned true")
		r.blockedReaders--
		return true
	}

	r.writeCond.Wait()
	if time.Since(start) >= r.wTimeout {
		// Try hook one last time before giving up
		if r.preWriteBlockHook != nil && r.preWriteBlockHook() {
			log.Println("[WAITWRITE] PreWriteBlockHook returned true")
			r.blockedReaders--
			return true
		}
		r.setErr(context.DeadlineExceeded, true)
		r.blockedReaders--
		return false
	}

	r.blockedReaders--
	return true
}
```

### üîÅ Summary

- **Blocked readers** are detected and prioritized via `slowPathPut`.
- **Hooks** are used to avoid unnecessary blocking and allow the system to auto-heal under contention.
- The design aims to **maximize throughput** while avoiding deadlocks or starvation.
- The hooks are used inside the ring buffer.
