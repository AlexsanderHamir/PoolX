# Possible Future Changes

## Performance Optimizations

1. Segmented Ring Buffer Implementation
   - Current behavior: Memory grows by allocating a new bigger slice each time
   - Proposed change: Implement a segmented ring buffer structure
   - Benefits:
     - Amortized cost of growing
     - More efficient memory utilization
     - Reduced memory allocation overhead
   - Implementation approach:
     - Create smaller buffer segments as needed
     - Link segments together in a ring structure
     - Maintain pointers for read/write operations
